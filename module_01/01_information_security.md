## what are confidentiality controls

1. Access controls: Limiting who has access to sensitive information based on their role, responsibility, and need-to-know.

2. Encryption: Converting sensitive information into an unreadable form to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure.

3. Data classification: Assigning labels to sensitive information based on its level of sensitivity and risk, and using these labels to determine appropriate access and protection controls.

4. Data masking: Hiding or obscuring sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure.

5. Data backup and disaster recovery: Ensuring that sensitive information can be restored in the event of a disaster or data loss.

6. Physical security: Protecting sensitive information from physical theft or damage by controlling access to data centers, servers, and storage devices.

## what are integrity controls

1. Hashing: Converting data into a unique, fixed-length representation called a hash value, which can be used to detect any changes to the original data.

2. Digital signatures: Using public-key cryptography to sign data to ensure that the data has not been tampered with and to verify the identity of the sender.

3. Access controls: Limiting who has the ability to modify or delete sensitive information based on their role, responsibility, and need-to-know.

4. Change management processes: Implementing a formal process to approve, document, and track changes to sensitive information.

5. Data backup and disaster recovery: Ensuring that sensitive information can be restored to its original state in the event of data loss or corruption.

6. Data validation: Verifying the accuracy and completeness of sensitive information before it is stored or transmitted.

## what are non repudiation controls

1. Digital signatures: Using public-key cryptography to sign data to ensure that the data has not been tampered with and to verify the identity of the sender.

2. Timestamping: Adding a timestamp to an electronic transaction to verify that it was created at a specific time and to prevent future tampering.

3. Auditing and logging: Keeping records of all transactions and activities, including who performed the actions and when, to provide evidence in the event of disputes.

4. Chain of custody: Keeping records of who has handled and had access to sensitive information to provide evidence in the event of disputes.

## Attack Classification
### Passive attack
Attacks that do not directly / actively engage with the target system(s).
Examples:
- Searching google (googling)
- Network traffic analysis

### Active attack
Attacks that do directly / active engage with the target system(s).
Examples:
- Brute forcing
- Sending malicious payloads
- Web app spidering

### Close-in attack
Attacks where the attacker is physically close to the target system.

### Insider attack
Attacks where the attacker is inside of the organization / infrastructure.
Examples:
- Shoulder surfing passwords
- Misusing privileged access
